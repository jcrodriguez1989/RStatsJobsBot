Twitter is one of the social networks most used by the R users community, and possibly the one that offers the greatest flexibility for its programmatic access ([`{rtweet}`](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet) [@rtweet-package]). In this regard, Twitter bots result as an excellent tool to promote our product or tool. However, it is not usual to find a wide variety of bots related to R, compared to other topics or programming languages. This is not due to greater difficulty in itself but to a lack of familiarity with the subject in R.

In this flash talk, I will show the learning path I took to bring an idea to [\@RStatsJobsBot](https://twitter.com/RStatsJobsBot), a Twitter bot that currently has over 750 followers. \@RStatsJobsBot runs completely on R, and is deployed and continuously running on Github Actions. I intend that after this talk, **you will be able to create your own R Twitter bot** without the need for additional hardware or a server.
